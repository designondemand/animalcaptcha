AnimalCaptcha
=============
> "A novel way to tell if you are a human ;)"
-- Maciej "mav" Trębacz

This is a php library which allows you to include a fun and simple captcha in any of your html forms.

The library is a fork of [Maciej's original library hosted at google code](https://code.google.com/p/animalcaptcha/) which has been inactive for quite some time. It also features cute and colourful animal images made by [Martin Bérubé](http://how-to-draw-funny-cartoons.com/).

Requirements
------------
The minimal requirements is that you have [php](http://www.php.net) running on a webserver and if you want random image effects to be applied to the captcha images (to make sure they are different everytime) you will also need either [gd](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) or [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) installed on your server.

Usage
-----
Please see [example.php](example.php) in the repository for a basic example of how to use the library.
